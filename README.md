# DIAFree

DIAFree is a workflow use to identify and quantify protein from spectra(.raw/.mzML).


Please alter basic.ini to reset the environments and then click on DIAFreeGUI.exe, then you are free to use!


spectra lib & predicted spectra lib(use pDeep) are unable to use only because I do not finish the UI logic yet.


This is a simple introduction because network issues make Upload To Github unable to finish!


Please download it from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/diafree/
